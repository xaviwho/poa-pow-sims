PoA vs PoW Simulation Framework for K-ETS Blockchain

This repository presents a simulation framework designed to evaluate and compare various blockchain consensus mechanisms—specifically PoA, PoW, DPoS, PBFT, and PoA Square—in the context of the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS). The simulations focus on key performance metrics such as gas usage, block time, throughput, finality, and validator reliability.

📖 Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a robust simulation environment to assess the performance and suitability of different blockchain consensus algorithms for applications within the K-ETS. By analyzing metrics such as gas consumption, transaction throughput, and validator reliability, stakeholders can make informed decisions on the optimal consensus mechanism for carbon credit trading platforms. 


---

✨ Features

Simulation of five consensus mechanisms: PoA, PoW, DPoS, PBFT, and PoA Square.

Evaluation of performance metrics including gas usage, block time, finality, throughput, and validator reliability.

Validator scaling tests with configurations of 3, 5, and 7 validators.

Transaction stress tests with varying transaction rates (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 tx/sec).

Automated generation of comprehensive performance reports in JSON format.

Visualization tools for analyzing simulation results. 



---

⚙️ Consensus Mechanisms Evaluated

Proof of Work (PoW): Traditional consensus mechanism relying on computational effort.

Proof of Authority (PoA): Consensus based on a set of trusted validators.

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): Stakeholder-elected validators participate in consensus.

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT): Consensus achieved through a multi-phase voting process.

PoA Square (PoA²): Enhanced PoA with validator reliability scoring and replacement mechanisms. 



---

🧪 Simulation Scenarios

Validator Scaling Test

Assesses how each consensus mechanism performs with varying numbers of validators (3, 5, and 7). Metrics evaluated include: 

Gas usage

Block time

Transaction throughput 


Transaction Stress Test

Evaluates the performance under increasing transaction loads (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 tx/sec) while maintaining a constant number of validators. Metrics evaluated include: 

Success rate

Latency

Maximum throughput

📊 Results Summary

Consensus	Avg. Block Time	Finality	Throughput (tx/s)	Reliability Score

PoW	15,000 ms	~90,000 ms	0.07	N/A
PoA	15,000 ms	~15,000 ms	0.07	N/A
DPoS	2,918 ms	~6,020 ms	0.34	N/A
PBFT	876 ms	865 ms	0.80	N/A
PoA²	8,194 ms	~8,194 ms	0.65	1.0


*Note: PoA² uniquely incorporates a validator reliability scoring system, enhancing network trustworthiness.*

🛠️ Technical Architecture

Local Blockchain Environment: Simulations run on a local Hardhat node with customized network parameters.

Smart Contract Deployment: A KETSBlockchain contract simulates carbon credit operations.

Account Simulation: Programmatic creation of regulator, validator, and industry accounts.

Transaction Sequence Generation: Automated transaction submissions with controlled timing.

Metrics Collection: Precise measurement of gas usage, latency, throughput, and success rates.
